# Critique of MIDUS study reproducibility

1. Is the data publicly available?
 Yes

2. Is the data easy/intuitive to access?
   Downloading the data is easy, but navigating the file system is not very intuitive
3. Is there a codebook and/or instructions about how the data and documentation is organized?
   Yes, they have documentation for each column and encoding
4. Are the file names intuitive?
    No
5. Are the variable names intuitive?
6. No
7. Is the software used for analysis publicly available?
   No, they use SAS v9.2 that is not available, and they do not give details of what they did on SAS
8. If the software is available, is it well commented?
   We did not find the code
9. Is there a toy example provided?
   No. 
10. Are you able to reproduce the figures, tables and results presented in the paper?
   Sort of. Broad trends are the same, but the exact numbers are different, we are misssing some people 
   and p-values are not the same.
11. Was there anything you think should have been made clearer, or explained in a different way?
    They could have specified the variable names they used in the paper, and explain how they cleaned and preprocessed
    the data. A flowchart would have been useful to understand all the filtering steps
12. Did you find any faults in the methods used in this paper? Would you have used more or different methods?
   We did not fully understand how they dealt with missing values, which could be a potential pitfall of the analysis.
   We couldn't find any other issue with the analysis.
